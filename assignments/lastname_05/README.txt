Assignment 05 - Sorting Algorithms
----------------------------------


The radixSort.html file includes an example of that algorithm implemented in JavaScript

In the sortingAlgorithm.html file, implement your assigned algorithm using JavaScript. 

----


Part 1: 

Research your algorithm and find the following information:

1. What is its space complexity?

2. What are the best, worst, and average cases for time complexity?

3. Is the algorithm stable? 

4. What are some real-world uses for it? Why?





Part 2:

Create a pseudocode version of the algorithm and explain, in 
your own words and to the best of your ability, exactly how 
the algorithm works:
