			// now, make you own:



			/* 
			1. print "Go Green" to the console if the name of the school
			   contains the word "state"
			*/




			/*
			2. if the name of the week is NOT 'Tuesday', print "not tuesday"
			   to the console
			*/




			/* 
			3. if the number of characters in the day variable is greater
			   than 5, AND the name of the course starts with 'XA', print
			   both of those variable names to the console
			*/    




			/* 
			4. if the time of day is divisible by two, print "even"
	       if it isn't print "odd"
			*/
