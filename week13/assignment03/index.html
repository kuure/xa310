	<h1>Assignment 03: Recursive and Non-Recursive Fibonacci Sequence</h1>


	<p>The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number is
	the sum of the two previous numbers - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so
	on.</p>

	<p>This page contains a JavaScript function that gives you the value
	based on running the calculation X number of times; for example calling
	<code>fibonacci(4)</code> gives you the answer of 5, an argument of 5
	gives an answer of 8, etc. </p>


	<p>You must add a new function named <code>fibonacciRecursive()</code>
	that implements the same functionality in a recursive manner - one where
	the function calls itself - and modify the README.txt file to explain
	your code.</p>


<script>

function fibonacci(num){

	let a = 1
	let b = 0
	let temp;

	while (num >= 0){
		temp = a;
		a = a + b;
		b = temp;
		num--;
	}
	return b;
}


// these numbers grow quickly...
console.log(fibonacci(5))
console.log(fibonacci(10))
console.log(fibonacci(20))




// Your job is to get the same thing happening below, but using a RECURSIVE algorithm 

// Then add your writing in the README.txt file
